### Want to know my list of things to be done better (if I would be MID or even more experienced Junior! ) without spending your precious time on it? Call me or send me an email. I can save you some time.

## Making mode:

- All of the commits accordingly to the work that has been done - you track the progress of my work with ease.
- There are few thing that I do not like, and if I have chance I would like to ask about.

## Took me in total:

- Monday: around 3hrs + 1,5hr on BJ rules.
- Tuesday: around 7hrs
- Wednesday: around 6,5hrs
- Thursday: around 1,5hrs

* I have never played 'oczko' or 'blackjack' so it took me some time to get the rules.
* I have chosen Vue - I am not really experienced in it, but its Vuex and state seemed to me the easiest way to finish the task in less than 5 days.
* I belevie that history would be better done even in MongoDB atlas (fast uplouad via express/next or even laravel) - if there will be need I can to it to prove I know something about it
* Is there an extra point for heroku deploy or create API to serve it in cloud? I did not have a chance to work with localstorage yet - so I can show that I can do some other things as well.
